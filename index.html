                <li>The signing of the Treaty of waitangi is one of the most important events that has happened in new zealand history, the Treaty of waitangi was created so that both Maori(the native people of new zealand) and the english could live  together in the same country with minimal conflict.</li>
                <li>The treaty of waitangi was so important to the maori people as it gave them the rights to their land and impowerd them to speak against the british crown when something wasnt right or fair to the first nations people .</li>
